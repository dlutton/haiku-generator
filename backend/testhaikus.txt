through the cold branches in a far corner of sky a single star shines
here there is no thirst from the stone the water flows inexhuastible
you wait in patience stillness the poem alights a bird on your hand
so cruel these fine tools the kill jar and the glass case for the butterflies
the rising music promises even weary souls can fly away
no theory no word no intent i was taken by the song alone
in the grand station the undulating echoes an ocean of sound
on the steel blue glass a hushed jet slips and shivers the city dreaming
a low stone grey sky the cold heavy on our bones faint lights in the dusk
in the still grey dawn the falling snow is ashes from the burning year
